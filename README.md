# Be My Valentine? - README

## Overview
This is a fun and interactive Valentine's Day webpage designed to ask someone to be your Valentine. The page includes a playful approach where the "No" button makes it harder to refuse over time while the "Yes" button grows larger. Additionally, clicking "No" displays cute and persuasive messages along with GIFs and unlocks special perks as incentives.i used what my gf likes u could tinker with phrases to tailor for yourself.

## Features

- **Perks Box:** Unlocks romantic perks each time "No" is clicked.
- **GIF Animations:** Displays adorable reaction GIFs to make the experience more engaging.
